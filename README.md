Okay, here's the thing:

I know that this code is not optimal. 

It was a fun-project for personal use only to get familiar with 
the curl and pcre c-libraries.

If you have suggestions or something like that, feel free to file a bug.

I only tested the code on a GNU/Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) system.
Use the "make.php" file to build the project.

Have a nice day.
